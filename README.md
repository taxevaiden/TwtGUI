# twt.exe

twt.exe is a twtxt GUI client that helps using twtxt a little easier for people who don't want to use the command prompt. it also may be more convenient for people like me who don't wan't to open cmd everytime and type

`twtxt timeline`

everytime. they can just open this app, look, and be done.

(i actually just made it because i was bored)

## requirements

you need,,,

- [python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.4.1: needed to install twtxt
- recent version of [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/): also needed to install twtxt
- [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), with everything set up properly: to use the app
- internet: it's kinda obvious why 

### compatibility

| OS | Version | Status |
|----|---------|--------|
| Windows | Windows 7 and later | Fully supported |
| macOS | Not supported | Not supported yet, uses Windows commands internally at the moment |
| Linux | Not supported | Not supported yet, uses Windows commands internally at the moment |

## status

it's not done at all yet. i mean you can look at your timeline but that's it. along with that it's windows only, i only plan to work on other operating systems AFTER everything's finished

commands executed internally on windows may not work as well on macOS/Linux? idk i have neither (if you count the terrible macbook i have)
