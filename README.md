# twt.exe

twt.exe is an electron app that helps using twtxt a little easier for people who don't want to use the command prompt. it also may be more convenient for people like me who don't wan't to open cmd everytime and type

`twtxt timeline`

everytime. they can just open this app, look, and be done.

(i actually just made it because i was bored)

## requirements

you need,,,

- [python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.4.1
- recent version of [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## status

it's not done at all yet. i mean you can look at your timeline but that's it

(it looks very bad)
